&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the commonly used terms today, would be &lt;em&gt;comfort zone&lt;/em&gt;. When one is in his or her comfort zone, one feels at ease and safe. Psychologically, one is inclined to stay at such state and not to change to a different state that would affect him or herself, at that point of time. Willpower is required to tell the mind to move out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/cgYPgqX.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Comfort Zone&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;complication&#34;&gt;Complication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, when one is at ease and one&amp;rsquo;s mental state wants to remain status quo for the longest possible time, results will be mediocre, in everything done. Then, when the time comes for one to evaluate how one&amp;rsquo;s life has progressed in the past years, reality hits hard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;What have I achieved these past years?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Years ago, I had set a goal for myself. How far am I from what I have set out to do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Have I became so complacent that the fire in me is perishing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/wxlyrmP.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Reflection&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflection&#34;&gt;Reflection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is always to continue to challenge oneself. When the feeling of comfort sets in, it is time to evaluate the environment one is in and find ways to push ahead. What may have been challenging before, may have been settling now. The pursuit for discomfort and challenges, never ends as that is when one truly discovers about oneself and the capabilities or latent potentials that one has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one life given by God on this Earth, venture to the unknown and explore the depths that life has to offer. Embrace the &lt;strong&gt;discomfort zone&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Savings Account in Malaysia</title>
      <link>http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/post/savings-account-malaysia/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2017 21:17:48 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/post/savings-account-malaysia/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Malaysians, at the very least, own one savings account. According to &lt;a href=&#34;http://databank.worldbank.org/data/Population-With-Acc-in-Fin-Institution/id/2a961711&#34;&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, 80.7% of Malaysians of the age 15 and above, have accounts in Financial Institution in year 2014. When compared to year 2011, it was only at 66.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an individual basis, one may have the following accounts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Savings Account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed Deposit Account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment Account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the focus would be in Savings Account, the complication comes when one is being bombarded by so many types of it. From Regular Savings Account to Basic Savings Accounts and other Youth Savings Accounts, Elderly Savings Accounts or even Branded Savings Accounts, it is no surprise that one would be confused with such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the big question is, &lt;em&gt;which savings account one should opt for?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer, &lt;strong&gt;it depends.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few factors that would affect one&amp;rsquo;s decision in deciding which type of Savings Account to opt for; they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desired Interest Rate level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequency of ATM withdrawals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequency of Over-The-Counter (OTC) Transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequency of Interbank Giro (IBG) Transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The need for passbook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other miscellaneous commercial requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;types-of-savings-account&#34;&gt;Types of Savings Account&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how many savings accounts, marketed by banks in Malaysia, they can be summed up to two main types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bankinginfo.com.my/Banking%20Info%20-%20Savings%20Account.html&#34;&gt;Regular Savings Account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bankinginfo.com.my/Banking%20Info%20-%20Basic%20Banking%20Services.html&#34;&gt;Basic Savings Account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to have a better understanding, lets have a quick run-through on what &lt;strong&gt;Regular Savings Account&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Basic Savings Account&lt;/strong&gt; are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/0lZeg7r.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Account Opening&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;regular-savings-account&#34;&gt;Regular Savings Account&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are a lot of &lt;em&gt;branded&lt;/em&gt; savings account offered by the local banks, the plain vanilla one, i.e. the regular savings account is pretty standard. Its typical characteristics are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No limit to withdrawal frequency in any ATM related to the local bank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passbook: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual maintenance fee / Card fee: MYR 8 per annum, indicatively for ATM cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some that place deposits with the bank, giving them moolah while they can use it to earn more money (Current OPR as of published date is 3.00% and typical weighted avg of interest paid to regular savings account is 0.10%. Hence, bank&amp;rsquo;s spread is 2.90% per annum, free money) and charging that extra fee there, may not make sense. With that, the other alternative comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;basic-savings-account&#34;&gt;Basic Savings Account&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 1-Feb-2005, Bank Negara mandated all deposit-taking banks in Malaysia to offer such facility to all Malaysia citizens and Permanent Residents, as per this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bnm.gov.my/index.php?ch=en_press&amp;amp;pg=en_press&amp;amp;ac=950&amp;amp;lang=en&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. Its objective, is to provide public with commonly used banking facilities to meet their general requirements, at minimal cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical characteristics for a Basic Savings Account are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OTC Transactions: Limited to 6 times per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ATM Withdrawals: Limited to 8 times per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IBG Transactions: Limited to 2 times per month at MYR 0.53 (inclusive GST), subsequently, the bank has the right to charge higher amount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passbook: None&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ATM Card: Yes, provided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual maintenance fee / Card fee: None&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, which account is appropriate for one? The correct question to ask would be, which savings account would benefit one, based on one&amp;rsquo;s lifestyle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than experiencing overload in information, one would have to structure them so that the decision made, would be an informed one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay smart!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is high-time now to update this site and now; instead of using &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; as the static site generator, this site is now using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; instead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/XDPrjrD.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jekyll.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;====== To ======&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/DRF8uNF.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;hugo.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The page generation speed for Hugo is insanely fast as it is built with &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; and it has a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;http://themes.gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;themes&lt;/a&gt; that goes hand-in-hand with your site&amp;rsquo;s intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly recommended indeed and back to writing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Art of Learning</title>
      <link>http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/post/the-art-of-learning/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/post/the-art-of-learning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;musings-of-learning&#34;&gt;Musings of Learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often said that one should never stop learning and the day when one stops learning is when he or she embraces failure or he or she is buried six-feet under. While there are so many things to learn, everyone ought to be selective on what to learn as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/images/learning.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Learning&#34; title=&#34;Learning&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Education institution has always supposed to be, a noble place for everyone to pick up knowledge. Notice the term, &amp;lsquo;supposed&amp;rsquo;. The primary reason why I put the term there is because, what is supposed to be a noble job has become a cash-cow machine or a propaganda tool by those that are in power. I have always been a supporter of capitalism, but when we have a scenario whereby people who did not put into effort are rewarded while people who worked their asses off are not rewarded, regardless of what system or mechanism is being put to sustain such &amp;ldquo;feel-good&amp;rdquo;, it will fail. For example, we have schools here emphasizing that the young padawans should memorize term by term for a moral examination. Probably sometimes most people do not get it but, &lt;strong&gt;memorizing or studying does not equate to doing&lt;/strong&gt;. It is unfortunate to see such noble institution deteriorate to such state, from such noble cause of moving human civilization forward to making people dumber by the day or milking the life out of others just to make money. Heck, as per &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs&#34;&gt;Abraham Maslow&amp;rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs&lt;/a&gt;, Esteem is one of the base that builds to Self-Actualization! Here we a situation, that people are attempting to limit others&amp;rsquo; access to knowledge to gain Esteem and impeding them from Self-Actualization. So much for &amp;ldquo;Fulfilling The Country&amp;rsquo;s Aspiration&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, with the power of the Internet, the capability of one to access knowledge is has been broken down tremendously. People now can &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Google&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; for information which they do not understand and also access to &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/app/itunes-u/id490217893?mt=8&amp;amp;ls=1&#34;&gt;free online courses of various discipline effort by esteemed higher learning institution around the world&lt;/a&gt;. Nowadays, college dropouts can embrace the power of the Internet by learning web development by themselves and start contributing to the social with useful web application developments and also make some green while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;being-fussy-about-learning&#34;&gt;Being Fussy About Learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our time in this world is limited. We will never know when we will get called by God and leave this world. Thus, it is imperative for us to manage our time from financial aspect to social aspect and that includes learning as well. During high school days, everyone is expected to learning more than 7 subjects and swallow in all the information and just regurgitate them out during examination. So much for learning indeed. Moving on to university, although one has a clearer idea of what he or she wants to do, the same principle still applies (swallow information, regurgitate them during exam), only in a more specialize subject matter. Finally, when it comes to work itself, only a handful of what is learnt is applicable to work. Talk about a waste of time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complication is, most people tend to learn things such as the most recent movies released and also the recent pop songs out in the market rather than focusing on the two skill category above. Seriously? Unless one has vested interest in media, there is no reason to shift most learning capability to the top media items out there in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, it is important for one to know what he or she wants to do in life and how he or she can contribute to the society at large. That will form the basis of how one allocates time to pick up important skillsets that will lead to the goal that is set. It varies among everyone on how long one will take to realize what he or she truly wants but that is the most important step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, lay out all the required skillsets to pick up and get going with the learning. Everyone has the following two big category of skillsets to pick up from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic Necessity Skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goal-Achieving Skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic Necessity Skills are skills which we cannot run away from. That includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic cooking knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hygiene knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one lacks even one of these skills, he or she has to depend on others and currenly unable to be independent. This is akin to being a toddler and require adults to constant feed him or her. If one cannot manage these Basic Necessity Skills, how will he or she be able to conquer those Goal-Achieving Skills?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goal-Achieving Skills can only be tapped into once one has properly handle his or her Basic Necessity Skills. Here is where one will project where he or she want to be 10 - 20yrs down the road and start working his or her ass off to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one may aspire to setup a software-as-a-service (SAAS) company. With that, he or she will commence acquiring the knowledge and skills such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubyonrails.org/&#34;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html&#34;&gt;Objective-C&lt;/a&gt; in order to build the necessary ecosystem of the SAAS, be it web application or mobile application. Only by having such knowledge then one can manage such company by hiring those others who are good in such field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to identify one&amp;rsquo;s desire, identify the necessary knowledge to achieve the desire and go and learn them and only them in the process of obtaining Goal-Achieving Skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;focused-learning&#34;&gt;Focused Learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During learning, one may spend long hours in order to gain the related knowledge. One may also realize that there are people who only spend one or two hours and may potential gain the same amount of information as compared to the earlier personnel before. How does one do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/images/mindmeditation.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Wonders of the Mind&#34; title=&#34;Wonders of the Mind&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is all about focused learning; when the mind is atuned to the subject matter, wonderful things will happen. That includes, increased knowledge absorption capability, increased knowledge retention period and increased understandng capability. One may learning items for a almost one full day and barely get anything out of it; that is a pure waste of time and it is a sin. Instead of allocating one full day to pick up knowledge, it is important to understand one&amp;rsquo;s limitation and use that period of learning with focused learning; then use the remaining time for mind-relaxation activities and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem like the obvious but one will be surprised on a number of people&amp;rsquo;s attitude when it comes to learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school.&amp;rdquo; - Albert Einstein&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dreams and Reality</title>
      <link>http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/post/dreams-and-reality/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/post/dreams-and-reality/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-desire&#34;&gt;The Desire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has always been one&amp;rsquo;s desire in order to achieve his or her goals. As per &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow&#39;s_hierarchy_of_needs&#34;&gt;Abraham Maslow&lt;/a&gt;, self-actualisation sits at the top of the hierarchy. The main criteria in order for oneself to achieve self-actualisation would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify one&amp;rsquo;s potentials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live them out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to desire. Everyone has desires or goals which he or she would like to fulfill during his or her lifetime. Through the the process of identification of goals and achieving them, one finds his or her self-worthiness and what it means to be oneself. Also, he or she would be able to associate with other peers who potentially share the same goals and work together to obtain the same achievement together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only self-actualisation is a self-rewarding stage of life, it also complements the Fourth Need (Esteem) and Third Need (Love and Belonging). Due to this, one is driven towards actualisation discovery regardless how long it may take (from months to years or even a lifetime).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-road-to-dream-realising&#34;&gt;The Road to Dream-Realising&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon realising the goal at hand, one would work out plans and ways in order to achieve it. From conceptualisation to execution, many form of paths will be experimented just to find the one that leads to the goal. Not to mention, finding mentors who one can look up to and also reading the journey undertaken by such mentors provide an additional nudge to continue to stay focus on the dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-stumbling-block-of-realism&#34;&gt;The Stumbling Block of Realism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reality starts to kick in at the early stage of feedback gathering. This is when one shares with even his or her close friends or family that what he or she set out to achieve. Naturally, they would provide advices which highlight the detrimental effects on going against the norm or the herd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking objectively, perhaps it is just the human mind&amp;rsquo;s tendency to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/24/your-money/why-people-remember-negative-events-more-than-positive-ones.html&#34;&gt;remember negative things stronger than positive ones&lt;/a&gt;. Having said that, we may just project what we deemed correct and our experiences which relates to his or her dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, when one breaks down the plan to manageable crumbs, the journey which may seemed quite short, is unexpectedly longer than before. The effort required to continuously pursue the goal and the long term focus is enormous. At times, after spending from hours to days to weeks and months, one would raise this question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it really worth it to pursue this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there are really two forces at play here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The external environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The inner-self&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-continuous-journey&#34;&gt;The Continuous Journey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all seems bleak, it is good to let intuition to take over the rational mind. One would just shut the rational mind which continuously feed information based on external environment (which may consist of noise and signal) and the inner-self and let the gut-feel come to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wonderful thing about intuition is that it is akin to one&amp;rsquo;s inner-call where lies one&amp;rsquo;s hidden potential. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200212/the-powers-and-perils-intuition&#34;&gt;Let it take over in a controlled manner can yield a powerful personal compass yet let it run wild and the after-effects are not to be trifled with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dilbert.com/about/&#34;&gt;Scott Adam&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dilbert.com/&#34;&gt;Dilbert&lt;/a&gt;, has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304626104579121813075903866&#34;&gt;great proposition&lt;/a&gt;. He shared that rather than being goal-oriented, one can opt to be system-oriented. That manner, changes the perception if a goal fails. One can pick up lessons learnt from failures and apply them to the next-big-thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the one who dreamt of a dream which transpired to a desire and goal(s), having to face the stumbling block of reality is part and parcel of the adventure. In the end, if one maintains sufficient focus and listen to one&amp;rsquo;s inner-self, that alone will set one apart from those who dream and work towards it and those who dream and do nothing about it. Such is a wonderful journey which lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a reminder to myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gold Rush</title>
      <link>http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/post/gold-rush/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/post/gold-rush/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-introduction&#34;&gt;An Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold rush has always been in existent since the early 19th century. During those times, its definition leaned towards a period of feverish migration of workers to an area that has had a dramatic discovery of gold deposits. Since then, things have changed. Our society is gaining awareness that the value of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money&#34;&gt;fiat money&lt;/a&gt; depreciates over time and they have been on the bandwagon to search for investment vehicles with high yield, many of which perceived gold as one of the suitable investment vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this modern era, gold rush has taken into a new look. People are now buying physical gold (in the form of bullion or jewellery) or even paper gold (in the form of Exchange Traded Fund that trades in gold) in order to hedge inflation risk and depreciating value of fiat money. The complication arises when it comes to evaluating and considering the need for &lt;strong&gt;sustainable&lt;/strong&gt; investment vehicle which one definitely feels that he or she is not gambling his or her hard-earned money on some odds which is uncontrollable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://demonocracy.info/infographics/world/gold/images/demonocracy-gold-400-oz.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;400 Troy Oz of Gold 999.9 Fine Bullion Bar by Demonocracy.info&#34; title=&#34;400 Troy Oz of Gold 999.9 Fine Bullion Bar by Demonocracy.info&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gold-rush-really&#34;&gt;Gold Rush, Really?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtly, there are many people who have made their wealth via investing in gold and realizing a profit (note that I have included a caveat, realizing profit). One does not make money and only enjoy unrealized gain unless one realizes it via selling the asset. Over the period of 5yrs, gold prices has increased above 50% from (2008 until 2013) as below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infomine.com/investment/metal-prices/gold/5-year/&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://charts.infomine.com?288&#34; alt=&#34;5 Year Gold Prices - Gold Price Chart&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the assumption that fiat money will decrease in value and inflation continuously increase, does buying gold effectively hedge those risks in a sustainable manner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets delve deeper into some of usage of gold which could possibly contribute to its demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the main applications of gold are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jewellery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dental&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aerospace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gilding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gold.org/&#34;&gt;World Gold Council&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; data for gold demand for the year 2012, below are some interesting figures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;45.5% accounts for jewellery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;34.3% accounts for investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8.1% accounts for technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12.2% accounts for central bank and other institution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Refer to this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gold.org/supply-and-demand/interactive-gold-market-charting&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; for more info)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the math above, one can ask a simple question, &amp;ldquo;Looking at the two largest chunks, jewellery and investment, does both of them really help to stimulate the economy and provide sustainable investment?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Charlie Munger shared, &amp;ldquo;Remember that highest and best use is always measured by the next best use&amp;rdquo;, thus, would be fair to compare with other investment vehicle. Lets take property investment, population has always been on the increasing trend (refer to chart below from World Bank).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://data.worldbank.org/share/widget?end=2015&amp;indicators=SP.POP.TOTL&amp;start=1960&amp;view=chart&#34; width=&#39;500&#39; height=&#39;333&#39; frameBorder=&#39;0&#39; scrolling=&#34;no&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it makes sense to invest in property be it for rental income or capital gain (lets hope there would not be another subprime mortgage crisis in the making).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Central Banks have been proven to use gold as their reserves, but to the fundamental economy, gold&amp;rsquo;s contribution is at a minimal. At the end, people tend to purchase gold because they perceive its value will continue to grow due to continuous demand from the Central Banks and also devaluation of fiat money; neglecting its economical fundamental contribution. This is almost akin to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania&#34;&gt;tulipmania&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tulipmania-a-classic-example-of-non-fundamental-economical-contribution&#34;&gt;Tulipmania, A Classic Example of Non-Fundamental Economical Contribution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 16th century, tulips were first grown in Western Europe. Not long later, the wealthy people in Amsterdam sought the bulbs, paid high prices for them. That is the onset of the world&amp;rsquo;s earliest financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the height of the tulip&amp;rsquo;s reputation, it became a must-have for all wealthy people. If they do not own them, they were considered to have bad taste. Not to mention, even the middle class people were caught in the frenzy, willing to spend preposterous price (for some, that involves half of his/her life savings) for a single bulb so that his/her friends will admire it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to have a feel on how crazy it was, the table below describes the price of a single Viceroy bulb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Value (florins)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Two lasts of wheat&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;440&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Four lasts of rye&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;558&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Four fat oxen&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;480&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Eight fat swine&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;240&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Twelve fat sheep&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;120&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Two hogsheads of wine&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;70&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Four casks of beer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Two tons of butter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;192&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A complete bed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A suit of clothes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;80&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A silver drinking cup&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;60&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2,500&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tulips were even traded on Amsterdam&amp;rsquo;s Stock Exchange and in other towns as well during the height of the tulipmania. Stockbrokers were cashing money into their pocket by creating fluctuation in the price of tulips and with such high demand, minor price flunctuation could translate to high volume of sales and purchases. Many individuals suddenly grew rich with this mania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People were purchasing bulbs at a high price and intend to re-sell them for a profit. Such scheme could not last unless there are proper fundamentally backed economic value behind it. Someone had to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs. At the dawn of its crash, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay inflated prices for their bulbs. With this realization, demand for tulips collapsed and prices dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people lost their savings and their homes due to their desire to join in the frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to read more on tulipmania &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thetulipomania.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always very important to do some number crunching along with rationalization on what investment vehicles to opt for. Always opt for the one which has proper economical fundamentals (such as stocks or property investments) which are backed by fundamental figures. At the end, we are the stewards of our own money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Of Wants and Could Nots</title>
      <link>http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/post/wants-and-could-nots/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/post/wants-and-could-nots/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have gotten the opportunity to talk to so many wonderful individuals (be it friends or families or strangers) throughout my entire life thus far and I notice an interesting trait from most of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I want to be successful in this field but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to spend time in learning it because [insert your own imaginations here].&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It baffles me, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-explained-in-scenario-s-complication-c-question-q-answer-a&#34;&gt;Introduction, explained in Scenario ( S ), Complication ( C ), Question ( Q ) &amp;amp; Answer ( A )&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the benefit of all, SCQA, also known as The Minto Pyramid Principle, is developed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barbaraminto.com/&#34;&gt;Barbara Minto&lt;/a&gt;. It is aimed to provide the writer or presenter an engaging introduction to his or her audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the effort to further my background of this post, let me share with you a scenario. We all are aware (or at least I presume we are), that with the concept time value of money, money today would worth more than money in the future. This is because, with the amount of cash which we have today, we can invest it (be it in properties, stocks, businesses, funds etc.) and grow the amount in future. Not to mention, inflation will drive prices up in the future causing rising cost of living. Due to the present opportunity to earn yields and the rise in inflation, thus the value of money will be altered. Many individuals shared with me that they are aware of the need to learn more ample ways to grow money rather than relying on their sole active income (aka employment salary) in order to ensure they can retire fast and rich. However, it is easier said than done, or at least what some may presume it as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bells strikes when it comes to the golden question, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you are aware of it (importance of understanding time value of money), why did not you act on it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. Some interesting feedbacks are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t dare to take the risk to do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t commit time for it because I need to work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have the money to do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I want to do it but I don&amp;rsquo;t know who to ask.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the list goes on. So much time have been spent to think of reasons but so little time spent on thinking the solution. Here is the thing, when we move on from young adults to family life, we would even need to devote more time for our beloved future family. That being said, we would even have less time to think about these let alone to act upon it. Then, the reasons continue to stay until one day, our brain reached &amp;ldquo;nirvana&amp;rdquo; thinking, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why am I spending my life doing something which I do not like to do and stay just because of the money? What have I achieved so far as being myself and contribute to the circle of people whom I interact with? When I die, what will I be remembered as?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; That is when the thought of life-crisis happen, be it mid-life or quarter-life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further on, the question I would like to pose out to all, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you serious in reaching your life&amp;rsquo;s goal and not allowing the shackles of finance to restrain you or are you just going to let life pass by you just like that and go with the flow?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I am definitely serious on getting my goals achieved and I would not allow financial conditions to restrain myself from achieving them. When I die, I would want to be remembered as the jerk to most of the people rather than the nobody to all. I am sure you all would want to as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From all the inputs which I garnered, I managed to summarize them to three main points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear of uncertainty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear of going against the herd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear of failing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fear-of-uncertainty&#34;&gt;Fear of Uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our scumbag mind works in an interesting manner. Our brain tends to resist change and always conditions itself to continue to work on things which it is familiar, not things which it is not familiar. Take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs&#34;&gt;Abraham Maslow&amp;rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs&lt;/a&gt; below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Maslow%27s_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg&#34; alt=&#34;Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs&#34; title=&#34;Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safety Need actually is just above the Physiological Need. That explains why our brain tends to be in a defensive mode whenever there are changes in the external environment of the body. Furthermore, it is programmed in a way to understand that, &lt;strong&gt;the best way of doing things, is continuously doing things which it is familiar with.&lt;/strong&gt; This actually happens due to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning&#34;&gt;Classical or Pavlovian Conditioning&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Pavlov&#34;&gt;Ivan Pavlov&lt;/a&gt;, he discovered this scenario via pairing of two stimuli in an experiment. He presented the dogs with a ringing bell followed by food. By repetitively doing so, he actually brought together two stimuli (both the dog food and also ringing of the bell). Thus, as the experiment progressed, whenever he rang the bell, the dogs salivated even though there were no food provided to them. The same goes for us; we have been so conditioned to do the ordinary things (e.g. put our money in savings, strive and aim high in employment and live the rat race), until our mind automatically falls back to it whenever we are being presented with different options which may turn out to be better for us in our lives (e.g. invest our money in an investment vehicle, strive for entrepreneurship to improve the needs of people and get out of the rat race).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One good reminder so that we do not fall into the pitfall of our brain&amp;rsquo;s tendency to be defensive and the classical conditioning which has been wired into us; would be, remind ourselves of successful people such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Richard Branson. They definitely went through times of uncertainty throughout their entire lives and guess what, they do not let uncertainty get the best of them but rather they get the best of it. We can do too, by continuously be open to options and willing to try different things in our lives. At the end of the day, it is always about the journey, not just the end goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fear-of-going-against-the-herd&#34;&gt;Fear of Going Against the Herd&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As human beings, we are a social species. We would prefer to have a community to belong to and seek accountability, respect and ultimately, love partner. From &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs&#34;&gt;Maslow&amp;rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs&lt;/a&gt;, Love and Belonging Need is just above Safety Need. This actually reflects the importance of belongingness for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The twist comes when most people tend to fear uncertainty. Usually, it is in the majority group rather than the minority. For us, if we were to try to act different from the majority, we would be fearful that we will not be accepted by our community, let alone, fostering good companionship with selected individuals from our community. As this cycle goes on, at the end, without realizing, we may potentially end up with the majority; being fearful of uncertainty and bearing a huge opportunity cost. All just because we are fearful that we may not be accepted in our community if we choose to act differently with our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is alright for us to always choose to be different and act as it is. Sometimes, we may ended up being unaccepted by our &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; peers but we may meet with others who are striving to be different as well and take charge of their lives like we are. Here is an interesting quote which can serve as a good reminder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Acquire worldly wisdom and adjust your behaviour accordingly. If your new behaviour gives you a little temporary unpopularity with your peer group then to hell with them.&amp;rdquo; - Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fear-of-failing&#34;&gt;Fear of Failing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/images/failureorsuccess.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Failure or Success&#34; title=&#34;Failure or Success&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do fear failure as much as everyone else do. I am always uncomfortable of failing and would want to be successful in whatever I am doing. I have never been so wrong before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/images/ihaveneverbeensowrong.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Yeah, I have never been so wrong before&#34; title=&#34;Yeah, I have never been so wrong before&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most education systems punish the so-called failures and promote the winners. That is indeed, not very practical to do so especially in real-life which we would need to try things out before knowing that we would fail or succeed. Thanks to such conditioning (yeah, I know right), even for areas such as our career or investing, we dare not take the first step for we fear that we would fail. We fear that if we were to opt for entrepreneurship, we would lose time and also potential promotion if we stick to our normal careers instead. Our peers would potentially surpass us during our absence as they continue to work on their role in their employment. In the investing perspective, we fear that a bear will come and maul our profits and potentially cause us to lose our initial capital as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing that &amp;ldquo;Failure is the Mother of Success&amp;rdquo; can be the first step to take, in order to overcome such fear. As cliché as the previous statement may sound, it is actually true. I would testify it from the perspective of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa_%28dance%29&#34;&gt;salsa dance&lt;/a&gt;. I dance salsa during my free time, and one of the main responsibility of a salsero is to lead his lady &lt;strong&gt;properly&lt;/strong&gt; on the dance floor. There are occasions (note the term, are) which my lead has to be improved as some ladies told me that they were confused on where I wanted them to do. That sucks, really, and it is a clean hit to the ego. With that, I just swallowed them and continue to note down what I ought to look out for whenever I social dance with ladies. Nowadays, there are times when the ladies commented, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was fun dancing with you! Thanks for being such a great dancer!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; They are edifying indeed but I definitely would note that it is a continuous learning process for myself. This implies the same in the area of investing and also career perspective. It really boils down to how badly we want it. If we really want it badly, we would take failures head on and learn to improve from it and one day, score the goal which we aimed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear is an illusion created by ourselves. It is up to ourselves to go against it head on and make a difference to our lives and the lives around us. Personally, I am always on the wrestle to ensure I do not give in to my fears and continue to set my eyes upon my dreams. With that, let me share a great quote with you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dream&amp;rdquo; - Eleanor Roosevelt&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Principles of Value Investing</title>
      <link>http://bryanwongbh.github.io/unconventional/post/principles-of-value-investing/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Practical/dp/0060555661&#34;&gt;The Intelligent Investor&lt;/a&gt; is definitely one of the best book for all value investors out there. It combines business philosophy, rationalization and mathematics to argue on the latent potential of value investing by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham&#34;&gt;Benjamin Graham&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n6rqj9PXCaI/URC2e8x5mVI/AAAAAAAAAZc/LNvJlrueZCQ/w395-h529-no/8EFEBC8D-916E-4B5D-B1B8-A6550588FC0D.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;The Intelligent Investor&#34; title=&#34;The Intelligent Investor&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing, according to Graham, consists equally of three elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company must be analysed thoroughly along with the soundess of its underlying business before buying its stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One must deliberately protect oneself against serious losses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One should aspire to be adequate return, provided he or she acts with reasonable intelligence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One great tip which he left regarding the purchase of stocks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are shopping for common stocks, choose them the way you would buy groceries, not the way you would buy perfume. - Benjamin Graham&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post summarises on the setup of Octopress on Openshift which utilizes Greyshade theme as per Unconventional.co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have mentioned in my previous &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unconventional.co/blog/2013/05/21/back-from-the-ashes/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, Unconventional.co is alive and kicking! Previously, it is hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.heroku.com/&#34;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; and powered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/natew/obtvse&#34;&gt;Obtvse&lt;/a&gt;. After Heroku added a 10k rows of DB limit for its Development box, I thought it was time to explore on another Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and hopefully, I do not need to change to another service.
Not to mention, I still got a lot to learn in terms of configuring a database (be it mysql or postgresql) to match it with a particular PaaS&amp;rsquo; offering (believe me, it is a pain in the a$$). Thus, having a blog that requires database configuration for a particular PaaS and maintenance is a hassle and I would much prefer to spend time to pen down ideas than to try to configure a database that works on one PaaS but does not work on another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openshift.com/‎&#34;&gt;Openshift&lt;/a&gt; for a fair bit and its &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openshift.com/developers/pricing&#34;&gt;pricing&lt;/a&gt; for its FreeShift is definitely attractive to most PaaS seekers out there (myself included). On the other hand, enlightenment dawns upon myself when I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;http://octopress.org/&#34;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt;. Without the need to manage database for blogging and also utilizing the hacker way of publishing via &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; to push updates to the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setup an Openshift Account&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setup Octopress and Link to Openshift&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install Greyshade Theme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to credit the deployment of Octopress to Openshift write-up to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shellco.de/&#34;&gt;Shellcode&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://shashankmehta.in/archive/2012/greyshade.html&#34;&gt;Greyshade&lt;/a&gt; theme design to Shashank Mehta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, it begins&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup-an-openshift-account&#34;&gt;Setup an Openshift Account&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this part, it is mainly about getting your own Openshift account and perform the necessary settings to accommodate Octopress deployment (for further details, please refer to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shellco.de/deploying-octopress-on-openshift/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The necessary steps are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click on Add Application in the dashboard of your Openshift account&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select and install Ruby 1.9 application&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy the generated git repository URL (As an &lt;strong&gt;example&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;ssh://abc1234@blablabla-foobar.rhcloud.com/~/git/foobar.git/&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup-octopress-and-link-to-openshift&#34;&gt;Setup Octopress and Link to Openshift&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, this will mainly describe on the necessary settings to setup Octopress in your local machine and subsequently push it to Openshift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the next steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In your terminal, enter &lt;code&gt;git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress&lt;/code&gt; at wherever you want to have Octopress in your local machine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter into the Octopress directory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In your terminal, enter &lt;code&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt; to compile the Gemfile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, type &lt;code&gt;bundle exec rake install&lt;/code&gt; to complete Octopress setup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the local Octopress and Openshift has to be linked together in order to make the deployment to the PaaS a success (that is why the generated git repo URL is copied earlier on!). I have been following Shellcode&amp;rsquo;s methodology in having a staging public directory. I think this methodology of having a staging public directory and utilizing only the necessary files to commit is disk-space relieving for most PaaS and I like it. Anyway, moving on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy the Gemfile and config.ru file generated from the Octopress setup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exit Octopress folder by going one level up or just enter &lt;code&gt;cd..&lt;/code&gt; in your terminal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;em&gt;_deployment&lt;/em&gt; folder and enter into it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paste the copied Gemfile and config.ru file into the &lt;em&gt;_deployment&lt;/em&gt; folder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt; to generate a Gemfile.lock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; folder in it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;git init&lt;/code&gt; to initialize the repository&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;git remote add openshift ssh://abc1234@blablabla-foobar.rhcloud.com/~/git/foobar.git/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;git commit -m &amp;quot;Initial commit&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exit &lt;em&gt;_deployment&lt;/em&gt; folder by going one level up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy &lt;em&gt;_deployment folder&lt;/em&gt; and enter Octopress folder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paste &lt;em&gt;_deployment folder&lt;/em&gt; within Octopress folder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;git add _deployment/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;bundle exec rake new_post[&#39;Hello World&#39;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit the newly generated markdown file however you want and save it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;bundle exec rake generate&lt;/code&gt; and this will generate some files within your public folder (&lt;em&gt;octopress/public&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter into the directory &lt;em&gt;octopress/_deployment/public&lt;/em&gt; and delete everything inside there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy all the files generated from &lt;em&gt;octopress/public&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;octopress/_deployment/public&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter to the folder &lt;em&gt;octopress/_deployment&lt;/em&gt; in your terminal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt; to add all the new files to be pushed to the Openshift repo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;git commit -m &amp;quot;New blog post&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;git push openshift master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you will see Openshift spewing some stuff out in your terminal to show the background jobs running and once you see &lt;code&gt;remote: Done&lt;/code&gt;, you can visit the URL of your blog in Openshift check how awesome it is to have it hosted there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup-greyshade-theme&#34;&gt;Setup Greyshade Theme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this is regarding the installation of Greyshade theme to Octopress. The few main reasons why utilize Greyshade theme are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responsiveness design (try use a mobile phone or tablet to view it, everything scales nicely)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple and clean user interface&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicely designed favicon included for social media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructions for this portion is adopted from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. So the steps in this part are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter into the octopress folder in your local machine via your terminal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:shashankmehta/greyshade.git .themes/greyshade&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to this &lt;a href=&#34;http://hslpicker.com/&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and pick a colour theme that you have not seen in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade/wiki/Sites-using-Greyshade&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In your terminal, type &lt;code&gt;echo &amp;quot;\$greyshade: *colour*;&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; sass/custom/_colors.scss //Substitue &#39;color&#39; with your highlight color&lt;/code&gt;; substitute &lt;em&gt;colour&lt;/em&gt; with your chosen colour theme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;bundle exec rake &amp;quot;install[greyshade]&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delete everything that is within &lt;em&gt;octopress/public&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;octopress/public/_deployment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;bundle exec rake generate&lt;/code&gt; and copy the generated files in &lt;em&gt;octopress/public&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;octopress/public/_deployment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add your updated files for pushing to Openshift repo by typing &lt;code&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;git commit -m &amp;quot;Updated theme for Octopress&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Push your update to Openshift repo by typing &lt;code&gt;git push openshift master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to the URL of your Openshift application and marvel upon the Greyshade themed Octopress, hosted by Openshift&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, with this &lt;em&gt;unconventional&lt;/em&gt; way of blog setup (rather than using readily-made available services such as Tumblr, hosted Wordpress or Blogger), learning via technology and blogging would definitely be fun! Cheers for your attention!&lt;/p&gt;

It is high-time now to update this site and now; instead of using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as the static site generator, this site is now using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) instead!

The page generation speed for Hugo is insanely fast as it is built with [Go](https://golang.org/) and it has a lot of [themes](http://themes.gohugo.io/) that goes hand-in-hand with your site's intent.

Highly recommended indeed and back to writing!
